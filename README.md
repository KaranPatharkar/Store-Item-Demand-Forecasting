# Store Item Demand Forecasting
This is a data analysis project that forecasts the demand for various items sold in a store. The goal of this project is to provide accurate demand forecasts to help store owners make better inventory management decisions and optimize their stock levels.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which consists of five years of daily sales data for 50 different items sold at a store. The dataset includes information on the item ID, store ID, date, and sales volume. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in this project, and is contained in the DF_DataSet.csv file.

# Methodology
The demand forecasting model is built using a combination of time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The time series analysis is used to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the historical sales data. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost are then used to forecast future sales based on the identified patterns.

# Code
The code for this project is written in Python 3 and is contained in the Store_Item_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook uses several popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

The notebook is divided into several sections, including data loading and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and model evaluation. Each section includes detailed explanations of the code and its functionality.

# Results
The results of the demand forecasting model are presented in the notebook using interactive visualizations that show the historical sales data and the forecasted sales data for each item. The model performance is also evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of time series analysis and machine learning techniques to build an accurate demand forecasting model for items sold in a store. The code and results can be easily replicated or modified for use in other demand forecasting projects.
